     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately.

     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation.

Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
     * @param timeoutSeconds Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

    /**
     * list or watch objects of kind ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding
     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param allowWatchBookmarks allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \&quot;BOOKMARK\&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server\&#39;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

    /**
     * list or watch objects of kind ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding
     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param allowWatchBookmarks allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \&quot;BOOKMARK\&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server\&#39;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

    /**
     * list or watch objects of kind CustomResourceDefinition
     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param allowWatchBookmarks allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with type \&quot;BOOKMARK\&quot;. Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server\&#39;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
     * @param timeoutSeconds Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
     * @param watch Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

     * @param fieldValidation fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set.

If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.

If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param namespace object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests.

     * @param namespace object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

     * @param namespace object name and auth scope, such as for teams and projects
     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
     * @param timeoutSeconds Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion When specified with a watch call, shows changes that occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on quorum-read flag; - if it\&#39;s 0, then we simply return what we currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param timeoutSeconds Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server\&#39;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token.

Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset

It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;.

The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls.

     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set.

If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.

     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests.

Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
     * @param timeoutSeconds Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
     * @param watch Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

     * @param fieldValidation fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection.

Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server\&#39;s discretion. Clients should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval, nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both.

Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.
     * @param timeoutSeconds Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
     * @param watch Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify resourceVersion.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
     * @param resourceVersion resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource versions a request may be served from. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

     * @param pretty If \&#39;true\&#39;, then the output is pretty printed.
     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results.

The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.
     * @param orphanDependents Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be orphaned. If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.

     * @param resourceVersionMatch resourceVersionMatch determines how resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where resourceVersion is set See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions for details.  Defaults to unset
     * @param sendInitialEvents &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x3D;true&#x60; may be set together with &#x60;watch&#x3D;true&#x60;. In that case, the watch stream will begin with synthetic events to produce the current state of objects in the collection. Once all such events have been sent, a synthetic \&quot;Bookmark\&quot; event  will be sent. The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with &#x60;\&quot;k8s.io/initial-events-end\&quot;: \&quot;true\&quot;&#x60; annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.  When &#x60;sendInitialEvents&#x60; option is set, we require &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; &#x3D; NotOlderThan   is interpreted as \&quot;data at least as new as the provided &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60;\&quot;   and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced   to a &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.   If &#x60;resourceVersion&#x60; is unset, this is interpreted as \&quot;consistent read\&quot; and the   bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment   when request started being processed. - &#x60;resourceVersionMatch&#x60; set to any other value or unset   Invalid error is returned.  Defaults to true if &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;\&quot;&#x60; or &#x60;resourceVersion&#x3D;\&quot;0\&quot;&#x60; (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

If true/false, the \&quot;orphan\&quot; finalizer will be added to/removed from the object\&#39;s finalizers list. Either this field or PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
     * @param propagationPolicy Whether and how garbage collection will be performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy. Acceptable values are: \&#39;Orphan\&#39; - orphan the dependents; \&#39;Background\&#39; - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents in the background; \&#39;Foreground\&#39; - a cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.

     * @param _continue The continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.  This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
     * @param dryRun When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
     * @param fieldSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their fields. Defaults to everything.
     * @param gracePeriodSeconds The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
     * @param labelSelector A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by their labels. Defaults to everything.
     * @param limit limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the \&quot;next key\&quot;.

If more items exist, the server will set the &#x60;continue&#x60; field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.
